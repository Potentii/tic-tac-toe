# Tic-tac-toe

> This software was created for a college challenge, so be aware that it doesn't necessarily follow the best practices in programming

This is a CLI version of Tic-tac-toe written in C, so in order to play you'll need to compile it fisrt, which can be easily done using [`MinGW`](http://www.mingw.org/) on windows with the following command:

```bash
$ gcc tic-tac-toe.c -o tic-tac-toe
```

This is going to generate an `.exe` file that can be double clicked to start the game.
